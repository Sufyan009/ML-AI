## K-Means Clustering

**K-Means Clustering** is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group similar data points together. It partitions a dataset into K clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.

**How K-Means Works:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Randomly select K initial cluster centroids.
2. **Assignment:**
   - Assign each data point to the nearest cluster centroid based on Euclidean distance.
3. **Update Centroids:**
   - Recalculate the centroid of each cluster as the mean of all points assigned to that cluster.
4. **Repeat:**
   - Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the cluster assignments no longer change or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

**Key Points:**

* **K Value:** The number of clusters (K) needs to be specified beforehand.
* **Initialization Sensitivity:** The initial choice of centroids can influence the final clustering.
* **Elbow Method:** This technique is often used to determine the optimal number of clusters.
* **Limitations:** K-Means assumes spherical clusters and is sensitive to outliers.

**Python Implementation:**

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Assuming 'X' is your data matrix
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=0).fit(X)
labels = kmeans.labels_
centroids = kmeans.cluster_centers_
```

**Applications:**

* **Customer Segmentation:** Grouping customers based on their purchasing behavior.
* **Image Segmentation:** Dividing images into different regions based on color or texture.
* **Document Clustering:** Grouping similar documents together.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying outliers or anomalies in data.

By understanding the K-Means algorithm and its applications, you can effectively use it to uncover hidden patterns and insights in your data.
